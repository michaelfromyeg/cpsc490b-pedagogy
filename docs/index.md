## About

A brief introduction to myself, the seminar, and who this seminar is for!

### Who am I?

I'm [Michael DeMarco](https://michaeldemar.co), an upcoming fifth-year student at UBC. I've worked as a software engineer, researcher, and teaching assistant during my degree. Through work as an undergraduate TA, I've found a real passion for teaching, and thanks to co-op extending my degree to five years, I have a bit of extra bandwidth in my final semester. I want to be able to share and build on that experience with a diverse group of former TAs, CS students, and folks interested in education.

So, I'm applying to host a course on CS education!

### What's this seminar all about, anyway?

The goal is to explore best practices in computer science education. We'll dive into the latest trends in technology, and explore their impact on education. We'll explore themes of justice and their relevance in computer science. Moreover, we'll explore how learners learn, and discover teaching strategies that take that into account. You will get hands-on experience observing teaching in action, giving a mini-lecture, and exploring CS education research.

For a snippet of topics covered, take a look [here](#seminar-schedule-and-plan-or-sample-syllabus). It's important to note this 'course' is a _seminar_, meaning I expect to learn hand-in-hand with the students who enroll in the course. While I'll look to draw on and share my experience as a TA, I am by no means an expert. This course will be highly collaborative.

### Who should take this class?

If you are...

- a former TA, who wants to dive further into teaching,
- knowledgeable about CS and want to be able to improve your technical communication,
- someone with a background in education who wants to maybe teach computer science one day,
- curious how learners learn, especially when it comes to CS concepts,
- or... just interested in this topic as a whole!

you should take this class!

## Logistics

As of 2023/05/31, the course is under review to the Student Directed Seminar program. Because of a few special circumstances described below, we're asking you for now to express your interest by registering for a CPSC 490.2W1 waitlist with no attached time for now. By September 20, we'll send out an application link to everyone registerd on that waitlist **OR WHO DID X (mailed you with specific info? filled out a qualtrics survey?**. We'll also ask for your time preferences for the course. By October 15, we'll send schedule and admissions/waitlist information.

As soon as the application form is ready, we'll also include it here and send the scheduling link to anyone with a complete application.

Special circumstances for student-directed seminars (SDS):

1. The SDS review process is ongoing and unlikely to be complete before registration time.
2. SDS courses often expect particular backgrounds from participants. We'd like to use a brief application to ask you about those factors.
3. SDS courses are limited to 15 registrants total, including the seminar's student host.
4. With such a small group, we hope to find a mutually agreeable time for as close to everyone as possible.

## Proposal

Note this is the proposal that was submitted to the SDS team at UBC. **It is pending approval and is subject to change to my discretion.**

### Seminar rationale

_Include your academic focus, the gap you wish to address in the UBC curriculum, any informing literature or frameworks, and academic rigour._

Education is rapidly evolving at the hands of technology. Advances in human-computer interfaces, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have revolutionized the ways in which we can teach. In addition, computer science has seen a dramatic rise in popularity as a discipline itself. These two trends coalesce to make computer science (CS) education an especially interesting area to examine in a seminar setting.

This material is especially important for and relevant to students. Undergraduates themselves are no stranger to the teaching role. Apart from potential part-time student employment as a tutor, coach, or instructor, numerous students are already teaching today at UBC. The Department of Computer Science hires many undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs) and provides only brief training on serving as a teaching assistant. Understandably, there is not sufficient time to delve into the bleeding edge of education research, though building better teaching teams could better serve the entire department and university. Beyond the classroom, teaching and mentorship are essential skills for engineers. The field is evolving rapidly and there is almost always upskilling to be done. Great senior engineers are able to effectively coach interns and junior engineers; knowledge of the best pedagogical practice would surely benefit aspiring developers.

Moreover, this is a gap in the Department of Computer Science course offerings. Currently, there is no coverage of computer science pedagogy directly, though of course there are ample offerings of computer science coursework and adult higher education (under 'ADHE').

In a seminar on computer science pedagogy, I would look to showcase recent work done in computing education research from professors such as Amy J. Ko at the University of Washington, Seattle (UW). There would be an emphasis on topics like teaching methods and tools, assessment modes, diversity in computer science, project-based learning, 'flipped classrooms,' computational thinking, and more. I would derive the course material and structure from existing courses at other universities, such as CSE492T: Equitable and Inclusive Computer Science Pedagogy, also from UW. However, I would supplement the course's material to better serve my peers based on my experience as a teaching assistant.

Through this seminar, I hope to engage undergraduates in a meaningful, semester-long analysis on how to teach computer science effectively. We'll explore this through the lens of technology, looking at current trends and exploring ways they could be leveraged in the classroom, alongside state-of-the-art CS education research. We will look at advanced material in the field, and students will be tasked with contextualizing this work within a real-world classroom setting during the term (via in-class observations). This will ensure an appropriate level of academic rigor is provided.

### Learning objectives

_Show the ultimate behavior change your seminar is hoping to achieve in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes._

By the end of this seminar, students are expected to be able to:

- Identify emerging trends in technology, and articulate ways in which these relate to pedagogy
- Read and report on cutting-edge research in computer science education
- Apply and iterate on modern frameworks for teaching and learning
- Understand how issues of diversity, equity, and inclusivity factor into modern education systems, and particularly within the context of computer science
- Leverage CS education research to develop and lead a seminar on a topic in computer science

### Learning environment

_Outline strategies or approaches to foster a peer-based learning environment._

I am an ardent advocate for a 'flipped classroom' approach to teaching. This involves having students come to class having completed an introduction to the week's topic, and then leveraging class time to discuss, apply, and analyze that pre-lecture work.

In practice, this would mean having students complete some kind of reading ahead of time and prepare discussion items based on series of questions assigned to the reading. ('Reading' here is used in a broad sense; the actual work may involve listening to a podcast or watching a video.) Finally, they would be given class time to challenge the reading itself and their peers' perspectives on the topic at hand. This would apply for the first four to six weeks of the course.

After this, 1-2 students per week would be tasked with developing a lesson (in some area of computer science), applying the themes of our previous discussions. Again, their learning here will be peer driven. Students will have opportunities to ask questions during the presentation and provide constructive feedback on each other's teaching styles.

### Commitment to reconciliation and equity, diversity, and inclusion

_Write a statement indicating how your course will take into consideration Goal 4 of the UBC Indigenous Strategic Plan and work towards decolonization through the inclusion of Indigenous Ways of Knowing, culture, histories, and worldview. Also indicate how you will foster an inclusive, equitable, and diverse learning community._

Equity, diversity, and inclusivity are the pillars of any meaningful classroom discussion, which is wholly central to a seminar-based course. In addition, designing a classroom structure and selecting content to raise awareness around Truth and Reconciliation in Canada is also vital.

I would create an inclusive classroom environment through using inclusive language (e.g., avoiding jargon, learning students' pronouns) and ensuring everyone is given ample opportunity to participate. In addition, I will ensure to commit to diversity in the recruitment process, seeking individuals from a variety of educational backgrounds.

Moreover, I will look to intersect discussions on education with contemporary issues surrounding inequality, particularly in Canada. Consider, for instance, that students attending private schools would have far more access to high-quality computers. Computer science as a course is often not offered at schools which can't afford it. Imagine saying the same thing about math! Inequality is something we need to address when it comes to CS pedagogy.

For a more complete treatment on this topic and how it relates to computer science curriculum, I would draw from this talk which I analyzed in CPSC 349.

### Role of coordinator

_Describe your positionality within the learning environment._

My objective as the seminar lead is to fade to the background as quickly as possible and focus on creating an environment for enriching discussion between students. To this end, I will facilitate an inclusive and welcoming environment, as alluded to earlier, that will allow students to participate without hesitation.

I'll provide ample resources and guidance for students in forming their individual presentations. However, come presentation time, I will look to take a back seat to the students themselves. I think a topic like education in particular is one met with strong opinions, as everyone has been in the student's seat before. Therefore, I expect there to be no shortage of discussion items. However, it's my role to ensure that (a) discussion is guided to address the learning objectives and (b) students are given equal opportunity to participate. Aside from that, I stand to learn as much from the students as they can from me!

### Coordinator suitability

_Share your previous personal, professional, and/or academic experiences that have prepared you to successfully design and facilitate a seminar._

I bring a diversity of experiences in teaching, computer science, and software engineering. My most relevant experience is that as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA). To date, I have taught 8 courses over 9 semesters, ranging from introductory computer science to upper-level computer networking to applied machine learning. This experience of collaborating with a vast diversity of professors on various topics has given me tremendous exposure to effective teaching styles and strategies. It's also sparked a keen interest in pedagogy as a whole.

Beyond formal teaching, I also regularly support students as a 'coach' for academics and navigating the early career as a software engineer. I host public 'office hours' using Calendly for scheduling. So far, I've hosted 50+ sessions for students of virtually all years and majors. I occasion share common themes on YouTube to support more students. This, along with my experience as a UTA, has tremendously supported my public speaking and facilitation abilities.

Finally, I bring 1.5 years of industry experience that has provided me a solid foundation in CS fundamentals. This technical expertise will be essential in interpreting the latest trends in technology. In particular, I have worked in engineering at Tesla, Amazon, and Samsung; I anticipate that experience will allow me to demonstrate how in-class experience can translate to industry success. An often-unfortunate truth with CS education is a rift between theoretical concepts and modern-day practices. I hope to show the gap can be small if instruction is done applying some techniques from this very seminar.

### Seminar grading and evaluation

_Highlight the types of assignments and strategies for evaluation._

- Observations (30%), students will be asked to visit and observe a computer science lecture (or tutorial) and provide a critique based on the learnings from the seminar
- Discussions (30%), participate in a weekly discussion thread on Canvas based on the week's reading, and reply to peers
- Project (30%), students will be tasked with preparing and leading a mini lecture on a topic in computer science using best practices
- Participation (10%), general lecture participation and support of an inclusive learning environment

This is of course highly subject to change. The key objective is having students continually apply the new ideas being explored. The goal is to have them gather evidence through observations, continually reflect on the content (via discussions and in-class participation) and produce a culminating project to synthesize the accumulated learning.

### Seminar recruitment and selection

_Identify the eligibility criteria for enrolment and strategies for recruitment and selection._

This seminar seeks to identify students who are (a) knowledgeable about education, but have less exposure to computer science, (b) knowledgeable about computer science, but have minimal background in education, or (c) who have a background in an intersection of those two areas. The goal is to attract a diverse crowd with some relation to and a keen interest in CS pedagogy. Many of the courses' key learning objectives are best achieved through discussion, and fruitful engagement is reliant on diverse backgrounds.

There will be particular emphasis placed on recruiting students with a background as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) at UBC, particularly from the Department of Computer Science itself. My goal is to recruit ~5-10 UTAs and provide with them with an enriching experience for potential future terms. As a current UTA myself, having taught 8 courses over 9 semesters at UBC, I plan on leveraging my personal connections within the department to maximize interest in the seminar.

### Seminar schedule and plan or sample syllabus

_Provide a schedule of topics or readings for the first 4 weeks, as well as the frequency of your seminar._

I would expect this seminar to be split across two sessions a week, each running for 90 minutes. In the first few weeks, the sessions would be a combination of lectures, activities, and discussions to set a solid foundation in computing education research.

In later weeks, the second lecture of each week would be replaced with student presentations based on selected topics and shortened to accommodate for time spent in observations. I would work closely with the department to ensure observations are done in accordance with policy and do not disrupt in-class learning.
